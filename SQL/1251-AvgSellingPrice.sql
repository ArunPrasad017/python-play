/*
Write an SQL query to find the average selling price for each product.

average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Prices table:
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30     |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
 
UnitsSold table:
+------------+---------------+-------+
| product_id | purchase_date | units |
+------------+---------------+-------+
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
+------------+---------------+-------+

Result table:
+------------+---------------+
| product_id | average_price |
+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |
+------------+---------------+
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 
*/
select p.product_id,
round((cast(sum(p.price * u.units) as float)/cast(sum(u.units) as float)),2) as average_price
from UnitsSold u
inner join Prices p
on u.product_id = p.product_id and u.purchase_date between start_date and end_date
group by p.product_id
