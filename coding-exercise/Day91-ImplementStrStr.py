"""
Avoid using built-in functions to solve this challenge. Implement them yourself, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.

Implement a function that takes two strings, s and x, as arguments and finds the first occurrence of the string x in s. 
The function should return an integer indicating the index in s of the first occurrence of x. If there are no occurrences of x in s, return -1.

Example

For s = "CodefightsIsAwesome" and x = "IA", the output should be
strstr(s, x) = -1;
For s = "CodefightsIsAwesome" and x = "IsA", the output should be
strstr(s, x) = 10.

passed for 25/27 cases

def strstr(s, x):
    if s == x:
        return 0
    if len(s) < len(x):
        return -1
    for i in range((len(s) - len(x)) + 1):
        if x == s[i : (i + len(x))]:
            return i
    return -1
